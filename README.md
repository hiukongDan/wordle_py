# Wordle... in python

I was trying to make an auto quordle solver, ended up making a simplest game :)


## Usage

```
Usage:
    /help       -- to print this help message
    /exit       -- to exit the game
    /hint       -- to get hint about current guess
    /solve      -- to sovle current puzzle if you are too confused!
    /restart    -- to restart current game with randomly generated word
    /new        -- to start a new game with a randomly generated word
    <5 letters> -- to guess a word!
Result:
    v -- correct letter
    x -- not in this word
    ? -- in this word but not correct position
```
